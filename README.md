# Novlo React App

I'm thrilled to be back and share one of my projects with you! It's a web app that lets you search for your favorite movies and games. I built it using ReactJS and let me tell you, I now understand why it's so popular! The app makes an API request to fetch all the relevant information based on the movie you've searched. It's been an amazing learning experience, and I can't wait for you to try it out!

As a massive fan, I had to set the homepage to Game of Thrones.
